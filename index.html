              <h2 class="title-bold uppercase">Unkraut n: weed (s pl ) [botan.]</h2>
              <p>I used to have a plastic pot for compost and it was dark green, forest green and there was the logo of the city council on one side. And there was a crack down the other from where I had tried to move it when it was full. It was too heavy and the sides burst and earth spilled out. I got soil under my fingernails.</p>
              <p>Last autumn I raked the leaves that fell and put them in there and this summer I cut the grass when it grew too long and put it in there. Now it all rots together. Soil entangled with grass leaks from the gash that the crack has left. I think of innards spilling out from a wounded stomach.</p>
              <p>But every Summer something emerges from the earth and blooms unexpectedly. Once there was a pepper plant, another time there was peppermint and carnations too that were white. The pot was so unruly and untidy and alive.</p>
              <p>The carnations refused to stand up straight and kept extending out to the leaves of the sycamore tree opposite. Like when you can’t reach something and you have to stretch as far as you can so you can just about touch it, just about graze it with your fingertips. And I’m imagining their encounter, carnation touching sycamore, petal caressing leaf, white caressing green, and maybe there’s paper on velvet or perhaps the breeze makes them dance in time, or perhaps carnation resigns itself to sycamore and offers its weight to leaf and they exchange scent, pollen, exhalation and it’s gentle and it’s curious.</p>
              <p>My flatmate scolded the carnation by attaching it to the wall. They forced it to stay vertical, away from the leaves. They tied a knot around its stem with coarse yarn. The loops were too even, too aligned, too tight. I winced.</p>
              <p>But the carnation stayed vertical for a day and the next morning it was horizontal again, reaching to touch again and I thought how rebellious it was and I admired it. The thread of yarn was unknotted, loose, draped over the hairy stem, hanging. But they tied another knot, a double knot, too strong and too violent. So now the carnation has no choice. It is uncomfortably upright and silently submitted.  Enchained in yarn, it watches the tree. ‘You can look but you can’t touch’, I remember being told.</p>
              <p>And my flatmate repotted the peppermint too. In a pot of its own it has plenty of space and fresh soil. When I repot plants I think I do them a favour, I think I offer them nurture. But I notice that the plant is uneasy and this time I’m wrong because this time I realise the plant was happier before because before it was unkraut whereas now it’s not because now it’s peppermint and nothing else, it seems.</p>

              <p>
                For now, repeat local paths:<br />
                Six streets, two trails along<br />
                The oligarch’s&nbsp;fat foothills<br />
                Now submerged in&nbsp;grey<br />
                Sewage swallowed down<br />
                Thirty stairs, a&nbsp;pipe burst

                Bubonic plague was body<br />
                wrecked by&nbsp;‘disorder in&nbsp;secretion’<br />
                OR&nbsp;the performance of<br />
                ‘useless acts of&nbsp;no&nbsp;present advantage’<br />
                Like draining an&nbsp;abscess<br />
                Liquidating assets<br />
                Without being awake

                For now, illness to&nbsp;you<br />
                is&nbsp;a&nbsp;history or&nbsp;a&nbsp;metaphor?<br />
                Though a&nbsp;path is&nbsp;just a&nbsp;stair<br />
                To&nbsp;repeat, at&nbsp;most a&nbsp;stuck song,<br />
                To&nbsp;hum and scuttle along<br />
                Damp edges- a&nbsp;rat who wakes<br />
                And sleeps predicting grey<br />
                rivers littered with literate lives.

She lives so&nbsp;far she needs to&nbsp;cross some hills<br />

In&nbsp;priceless wooden heels<br />
She crumbles twigs and juicy leaves. Damp leaves<br />
And brings this moisty dirt to&nbsp;the city. Scrambles her joints into a&nbsp;walk<br />
that gets elegant and stronger<br />

I&nbsp;need to&nbsp;translate Them. They put its nose to&nbsp;the sand to&nbsp;listen<br />

  A&nbsp;crack in&nbsp;your wall, on&nbsp;your desktop A&nbsp;slit of&nbsp;the sky<br />
a&nbsp;crack on&nbsp;a&nbsp;muscle<br />
A&nbsp;crooked nerve<br />
A&nbsp;cleft in&nbsp;your teeth somehow. That is&nbsp;who you are<br />

<p>
Things come from my&nbsp;feet That is&nbsp;how I&nbsp;am&nbsp;a&nbsp;conduit<br />

<p>
The walnut broke off and exploded Letters into ripples<br />
exploded my&nbsp;desk under the walnut, her desk over Alexanderplatz<br />
Go&nbsp;out, look around<br />
</p>
<p>
Only if&nbsp;people knew how I&nbsp;do&nbsp;it, I&nbsp;google synonyms and then say it&nbsp;out loud<br />
many times and pick up&nbsp;words that I&nbsp;like with their sounds. So&nbsp;unprofessional<br />
I&nbsp;am&nbsp;not a&nbsp;linguist<br />

<p>
She is&nbsp;a&nbsp;walnut seller<br />
That’s&nbsp;her main job<br />
That never became a&nbsp;profession<br />
She is&nbsp;writing mainly about what she is&nbsp;selling as&nbsp;she doesn&rsquo;t know much more things<br />
She knows, Chicken, dogs, she knows work, she knows geese<br />
she knows nuts<br />
She likes to&nbsp;sell little objects<br />
</p>
<p>
Of&nbsp;course I&nbsp;don’t&nbsp;have all these words in&nbsp;my&nbsp;head or&nbsp;inside of&nbsp;me.<br />
They are outside and I&nbsp;go&nbsp;shopping for them like in&nbsp;a&nbsp;supermarket.<br />

              <h2 class="title-bold uppercase">June Poem</h2>
                  <p>
               I’m&nbsp;under midday sun<br />
diced bare by&nbsp;Reuterplatz trellis. I’m&nbsp;thinking about the incline your pelvis took<br />
and how your breath catches when you wedge into me,<br />
when what’s&nbsp;usually plaza<br />
a&nbsp;tight street<br />
leads off from becomes shadowboxing.<br />
The cosmos bends you<br />
over at&nbsp;your best and worst.<br />
Let all of&nbsp;it&nbsp;lap you,<br />
twice, three times round.<br />
Belted by&nbsp;it&nbsp;let the shift we&nbsp;might shape be<br />
mutual. Retune<br />
the militant you<br />
thought you<br />
knew me&nbsp;like.<br />
You’re&nbsp;not a&nbsp;warship.<br />
I&nbsp;never wasn’t&nbsp;mutant<br />
under midday sun<br />
the Reuterplatz trellis<br />
cuts but cuts hardly.<br />
The aliens are here already.
              </p>
              <h2 class="title-bold uppercase">Pilot light</h2>
              <p>I&nbsp;find what I&nbsp;want to&nbsp;be&nbsp;simple as&nbsp;time splayed<br />
over dayfuse<br />
Maintenance and red weight get taken off the image<br />
and a&nbsp;visible pilot<br />
with the flame still cradled<br />
Maybe I’m&nbsp;bugging Maybe what crowbar hope funded sits idle against a&nbsp;corner of&nbsp;granite no&nbsp;longer and the flicker one saw that light funnel Saturday was<br />
no&nbsp;fire just coin<br />
What a&nbsp;palm it&nbsp;is&nbsp;regardless that the odds I’m&nbsp;at&nbsp;with you soften<br />
get their due given<br />
seem to&nbsp;say what<br />
pact rhythm rides with air Know it’s&nbsp;tripwire<br />
and tenable<br />
as&nbsp;red wind and know<br />
to&nbsp;hold it&nbsp;nonetheless</p>
