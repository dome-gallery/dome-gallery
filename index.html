              <p class="uppercase">Unkraut n: weed (s pl ) [botan.]</p>
              <p>I used to have a plastic pot for compost and it was dark green, forest green and there was the logo of the city council on one side. And there was a crack down the other from where I had tried to move it when it was full. It was too heavy and the sides burst and earth spilled out. I got soil under my fingernails.</p>
              <p>Last autumn I raked the leaves that fell and put them in there and this summer I cut the grass when it grew too long and put it in there. Now it all rots together. Soil entangled with grass leaks from the gash that the crack has left. I think of innards spilling out from a wounded stomach.</p>
              <p>But every Summer something emerges from the earth and blooms unexpectedly. Once there was a pepper plant, another time there was peppermint and carnations too that were white. The pot was so unruly and untidy and alive.</p>
              <p>The carnations refused to stand up straight and kept extending out to the leaves of the sycamore tree opposite. Like when you can’t reach something and you have to stretch as far as you can so you can just about touch it, just about graze it with your fingertips. And I’m imagining their encounter, carnation touching sycamore, petal caressing leaf, white caressing green, and maybe there’s paper on velvet or perhaps the breeze makes them dance in time, or perhaps carnation resigns itself to sycamore and offers its weight to leaf and they exchange scent, pollen, exhalation and it’s gentle and it’s curious.</p>
              <p>My flatmate scolded the carnation by attaching it to the wall. They forced it to stay vertical, away from the leaves. They tied a knot around its stem with coarse yarn. The loops were too even, too aligned, too tight. I winced.</p>
              <p>But the carnation stayed vertical for a day and the next morning it was horizontal again, reaching to touch again and I thought how rebellious it was and I admired it. The thread of yarn was unknotted, loose, draped over the hairy stem, hanging. But they tied another knot, a double knot, too strong and too violent. So now the carnation has no choice. It is uncomfortably upright and silently submitted.  Enchained in yarn, it watches the tree. ‘You can look but you can’t touch’, I remember being told.</p>
              <p>And my flatmate repotted the peppermint too. In a pot of its own it has plenty of space and fresh soil. When I repot plants I think I do them a favour, I think I offer them nurture. But I notice that the plant is uneasy and this time I’m wrong because this time I realise the plant was happier before because before it was unkraut whereas now it’s not because now it’s peppermint and nothing else, it seems.</p>

              <p>Soon the fluids, furrowed like the earth by lighting, like a volcano tormented by subterranean upheavals, seek an outlet. – Antonin Artaud, “Theatre and The Plague</p>
              <p>
                For now, repeat local paths:<br />
                Six streets, two trails along<br />
                The oligarch’s&nbsp;fat foothills<br />
                Now submerged in&nbsp;grey<br />
                Sewage swallowed down<br />
                Thirty stairs, a&nbsp;pipe burst
              </p>
              <p>
                Bubonic plague was body<br />
                wrecked by&nbsp;‘disorder in&nbsp;secretion’<br />
                OR&nbsp;the performance of<br />
                ‘useless acts of&nbsp;no&nbsp;present advantage’<br />
                Like draining an&nbsp;abscess<br />
                Liquidating assets<br />
                Without being awake
              </p>
              <p>
                For now, illness to&nbsp;you<br />
                is&nbsp;a&nbsp;history or&nbsp;a&nbsp;metaphor?<br />
                Though a&nbsp;path is&nbsp;just a&nbsp;stair<br />
                To&nbsp;repeat, at&nbsp;most a&nbsp;stuck song,<br />
                To&nbsp;hum and scuttle along<br />
                Damp edges- a&nbsp;rat who wakes<br />
                And sleeps predicting grey<br />
                rivers littered with literate lives.
