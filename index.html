              <h2 class="title-bold uppercase">Unkraut n: weed (s pl ) [botan.]</h2>
              <p>I used to have a plastic pot for compost and it was dark green, forest green and there was the logo of the city council on one side. And there was a crack down the other from where I had tried to move it when it was full. It was too heavy and the sides burst and earth spilled out. I got soil under my fingernails.</p>
              <p>Last autumn I raked the leaves that fell and put them in there and this summer I cut the grass when it grew too long and put it in there. Now it all rots together. Soil entangled with grass leaks from the gash that the crack has left. I think of innards spilling out from a wounded stomach.</p>
              <p>But every Summer something emerges from the earth and blooms unexpectedly. Once there was a pepper plant, another time there was peppermint and carnations too that were white. The pot was so unruly and untidy and alive.</p>
              <p>The carnations refused to stand up straight and kept extending out to the leaves of the sycamore tree opposite. Like when you can’t reach something and you have to stretch as far as you can so you can just about touch it, just about graze it with your fingertips. And I’m imagining their encounter, carnation touching sycamore, petal caressing leaf, white caressing green, and maybe there’s paper on velvet or perhaps the breeze makes them dance in time, or perhaps carnation resigns itself to sycamore and offers its weight to leaf and they exchange scent, pollen, exhalation and it’s gentle and it’s curious.</p>
              <p>My flatmate scolded the carnation by attaching it to the wall. They forced it to stay vertical, away from the leaves. They tied a knot around its stem with coarse yarn. The loops were too even, too aligned, too tight. I winced.</p>
              <p>But the carnation stayed vertical for a day and the next morning it was horizontal again, reaching to touch again and I thought how rebellious it was and I admired it. The thread of yarn was unknotted, loose, draped over the hairy stem, hanging. But they tied another knot, a double knot, too strong and too violent. So now the carnation has no choice. It is uncomfortably upright and silently submitted.  Enchained in yarn, it watches the tree. ‘You can look but you can’t touch’, I remember being told.</p>
              <p>And my flatmate repotted the peppermint too. In a pot of its own it has plenty of space and fresh soil. When I repot plants I think I do them a favour, I think I offer them nurture. But I notice that the plant is uneasy and this time I’m wrong because this time I realise the plant was happier before because before it was unkraut whereas now it’s not because now it’s peppermint and nothing else, it seems.</p>

              <p>Soon the fluids, furrowed like the earth by lighting, like a volcano tormented by subterranean upheavals, seek an outlet. – Antonin Artaud, “Theatre and The Plague</p>
              <p>
                For now, repeat local paths:<br />
                Six streets, two trails along<br />
                The oligarch’s&nbsp;fat foothills<br />
                Now submerged in&nbsp;grey<br />
                Sewage swallowed down<br />
                Thirty stairs, a&nbsp;pipe burst
              </p>

                Bubonic plague was body<br />
                wrecked by&nbsp;‘disorder in&nbsp;secretion’<br />
                OR&nbsp;the performance of<br />
                ‘useless acts of&nbsp;no&nbsp;present advantage’<br />
                Like draining an&nbsp;abscess<br />
                Liquidating assets<br />
                Without being awake

                For now, illness to&nbsp;you<br />
                is&nbsp;a&nbsp;history or&nbsp;a&nbsp;metaphor?<br />
                Though a&nbsp;path is&nbsp;just a&nbsp;stair<br />
                To&nbsp;repeat, at&nbsp;most a&nbsp;stuck song,<br />
                To&nbsp;hum and scuttle along<br />
                Damp edges- a&nbsp;rat who wakes<br />
                And sleeps predicting grey<br />
                rivers littered with literate lives.

exploded my&nbsp;desk under the walnut, her desk<br />
 over Alexanderplatz<br />
Go&nbsp;out, look around<br />

<p>
Only if&nbsp;people knew how I&nbsp;do&nbsp;it, I&nbsp;google<br />
 synonyms and then say it&nbsp;out loud<br />

 their sounds. So&nbsp;unprofessional<br />

She knows, Chicken, dogs, she knows work,<br />
 she knows geese<br />
she knows nuts<br />
She likes to&nbsp;sell little objects<br />

It&nbsp;starts from the foot your foot drifts you away<br />
 ‘’Drop it’’ Your books<br />
Hold on<br />
to&nbsp;your feet<br />
</p>
<p>It&nbsp;is&nbsp;just a&nbsp;thought bubble with no&nbsp;words in&nbsp;it. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;about the<br />
shape of&nbsp;the thought bubble<br />
so&nbsp;cute<br />
They bump into each other Rub And float<br />
And rub us<br />
Like with ur&nbsp;lover in&nbsp;the water<br />
</p>
<p>
A&nbsp;crusty sheet On&nbsp;crumpled soil<br />
I&nbsp;bump my&nbsp;head up&nbsp;on&nbsp;this root<br />
I&nbsp;do&nbsp;want to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;strong backbone</p>
</p>
<p>
კაკალს ტეხავს CRUSHES THE WALNUT
</p>
<p>Crazing<br />
I&nbsp;cut sentences, words and look between them<br />
I&nbsp;just slit and stitch on&nbsp;my&nbsp;laptop<br />
I&nbsp;can’t&nbsp;sleep without a&nbsp;laptop open in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;me. Benevo- <br />
lence of&nbsp;this shape<br />
I&nbsp;think it’s&nbsp;rude to&nbsp;just disappear<br />
I&nbsp;want it&nbsp;to&nbsp;know why I&nbsp;am&nbsp;absent So&nbsp;it&nbsp;sees I&nbsp;<br />
sleep in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;it<br />
I&nbsp;think I&nbsp;owe it&nbsp;something<br />
I&nbsp;also have so&nbsp;much respect for the job it&nbsp;does for me,<br />
It&nbsp;keeps all my&nbsp;words<br />
I&nbsp;think it&nbsp;should get paid from my&nbsp;salary<br />
</p>
<p>

With the night She wants to&nbsp;rush things, takes <br />
ketonal wants to&nbsp;go&nbsp;out at&nbsp;night,<br />
her favorite panties are in&nbsp;the washer and <br />
everything is&nbsp;ruined<br />
The night<br />
She has been preparing herself for hours.</p>
Nerves, <br />
everything is Ruined<br />
Its brokeeeen Ruiiiined its broken ნერვი<br />
აღარ არის .... ფეხის გულზე გაწყდა<br />

Nerve is torn on the sole, Gone<br />
its gone, Agharaaa,<br />

</p>

<p>popped up&nbsp;root on&nbsp;your playground <br />
On&nbsp;your hand<br />
On&nbsp;your forehead<br />
A&nbsp;slapping nerve on&nbsp;the pavement<br />
On&nbsp;the shell<br />
A&nbsp;translator in&nbsp;a&nbsp;crevice<br />
On&nbsp;the cliff<br />
Another creature of&nbsp;a&nbsp;language<br />
Melding transmixing of&nbsp;e,v,e,r,ything, thought<br />
bubbles hugging.<br />
Weeping Mountain airport, a&nbsp;Transit, conduit <br />
that is&nbsp;not a&nbsp;space yet&hellip;that is&nbsp;a&nbsp;creature in&nbsp;<br />
forming, a&nbsp;tongue that is&nbsp;disappearing.<br />
A&nbsp;body that is&nbsp;crazing. A&nbsp;bubble with a&nbsp;crack <br />
for the leaf.<br />
A&nbsp;mouth that is&nbsp;a&nbsp;scribble.<br />
</p>
<p>

it’s&nbsp;a&nbsp;wooden heel<br />
it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;wooden heel that made crevice over <br />
the mountain to&nbsp;the sea<br />
ceviche<br />
you like<br />
My&nbsp;desk is&nbsp;under the walnut<br />
Her desk is&nbsp;over Alexanderplatz<br />
my&nbsp;soles<br />
they crumble the earth<br />
heels craze, crazing heels<br />
mark the wet soil<br />
</p>

<p>they crumble themselves too, soles <br />
walnut cracker, symbolic nut<br />
the root of&nbsp;your tooth comes out on&nbsp;my&nbsp;<br />
playground<br />
then I&nbsp;remember our words scattered around the internet <br />
I&nbsp;want to&nbsp;blow them back into my&nbsp;limbs and swallow<br />
I&nbsp;want to&nbsp;eat the screen, eat the hard drive<br />
I&nbsp;want to&nbsp;carry our books on&nbsp;my&nbsp;chest<br />
And store the words into walnut shells<br />
</p>

<p>

My&nbsp;eyes run through little shapes, some words catch me&nbsp;<br />
and do&nbsp;not let go, I&nbsp;like them too much to&nbsp;let go. Let’s&nbsp;<br />
have a&nbsp;moment together, cuddle. What can I&nbsp;do&nbsp;with you,<br />
 how can I&nbsp;touch you.<br />
If&nbsp;it&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;paper phone or&nbsp;a&nbsp;book, I&nbsp;hug it&nbsp;in&nbsp;my&nbsp;chest.what <br />
to&nbsp;do&nbsp;if&nbsp;this is&nbsp;a&nbsp;thought?<br />
What can I&nbsp;do&nbsp;with you, I&nbsp;like you too much, and I&nbsp;can’t&nbsp;<br />
get enough staring at&nbsp;your negative outlines. How can I&nbsp;<br />
sculpt my&nbsp;liking in&nbsp;the moment, how can I&nbsp;talk about this<br />
 when they are not anything specific they drift and smash my&nbsp;<br />
bone scaffold</p>

<p>I&nbsp;see her wooden house<br />
from this tree<br />
I&nbsp;have an&nbsp;extra limb for hanging, I&nbsp;hang out here<br />
Cracks she wrote<br />
If&nbsp;she looked outside there are cracks all around her <br />
actually this part of&nbsp;the world is&nbsp;a&nbsp;crack<br />
Tectonic plates have changed their outlines and seas and<br />
 mountains and her yard too, There is&nbsp;a&nbsp;broken mountain <br />
 laying next to&nbsp;her house. A&nbsp;chunk of&nbsp;mountain and plus <br />
 trees are like crooked veins they have been through wild <br />
 fires and storms and fires<br />
And the ground is&nbsp;all crumbled<br />
</p>

<p>

I&nbsp;like that she was painting with sticks and jam On&nbsp;back- <br />
sides of&nbsp;chocolate boxes<br />
And that is&nbsp;the high art<br />
It&nbsp;makes sense<br />
In&nbsp;her town there was this acclaimed writer She went to&nbsp;<br />
his reading once<br />
Now she is&nbsp;the artist in&nbsp;the town People go&nbsp;to&nbsp;this town to&nbsp;<br />
meet her<br />
</p>

<p>
I&nbsp;guess this is&nbsp;how it&nbsp;was before the 20th century<br />
U&nbsp;don’t&nbsp;have many chances, live fast die young<br />
U&nbsp;have only one chance<br />
If&nbsp;you’re&nbsp;not lucky nobody cares. no&nbsp;one will read you, no&nbsp;<br />
one will see you U&nbsp;will grow up&nbsp;quickly u&nbsp;either meet the <br />
right people or&nbsp;not then you die<br />
Enjoy</p>

<p>You are my&nbsp;favourite crevice,<br />
your negative lines are so&nbsp;beautiful <br />
There are earth drought crisps<br />
Not a&nbsp;black powder<br />
But washed away and kind of&nbsp;dried<br />
 potato crisps<br />
It&nbsp;crumbles with ur&nbsp;heels<br />
I&nbsp;like it<br />
</p>

<p>
There is&nbsp;a&nbsp;crack on&nbsp;my&nbsp;building block it&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;<br />
promise to&nbsp;split the house into separate<br />
 gravitational petals<br />
magnolias<br />
But for now there are some little bugs living in&nbsp;<br />
it, with tiny plants, these miniature things may <br />
explode in&nbsp;size when this house opens up&nbsp;a&nbsp;<br />
flower Huge scribbles will burst out<br />
I&nbsp;think insects also like cracks their negative<br />
homes<br />
</p>

<p>
The outline of&nbsp;the word, the edge of&nbsp;<br />
it&nbsp;Peels its shell off<br />
Drops the Naked thigh<br />
my&nbsp;limbs<br />
Happen so, a&nbsp;sediment Of&nbsp;hug<br />
</p>

<p>
It&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;speech bubble without words in&nbsp;it<br />
a&nbsp;space for hugs<br />
from the outline of&nbsp;ur&nbsp;letter till the edge of&nbsp;mine <br />
I&nbsp;lose my&nbsp;vertebrate and become a&nbsp;limbed jelly <br />
many limbs there is&nbsp;no&nbsp;head<br />
some shapes for touching only<br />
Jelly limbs<br />
My&nbsp;limbs are a&nbsp;conduit and I&nbsp;know translation <br />
can be&nbsp;my&nbsp;hugging. These negative shapes <br />
between my&nbsp;body and your shapes are <br />
the cracks I&nbsp;was talking about, I&nbsp;am&nbsp;interested in. <br />
This is&nbsp;what I&nbsp;want to&nbsp;fix and look at. <br />
Translation is&nbsp;the way to&nbsp;touch you to&nbsp;digest <br />
you and move on. I&nbsp;have fixed the moment of&nbsp;<br />
the liking and I&nbsp;can move on.<br />
I&nbsp;can remember<br />
You are my&nbsp;favourite crack</p>
</p>

<p>
my crush <br />
my crushed candy mouth <br />
საუკეთესო ბზარი შენობაზე<br />
even on my building<br />
</p>

<p>
in my backyard even<br />
the best crevice<br />
in my eye too<br />
შუბლს შორის on my forehead root <br />
ნახატივით as a drawing<br />
Nakhativit as a scribble <br />
from that mountain<br />
from cartoonist<br />
with the lights on its shore<br />
</p>

<p>
to the wooden house that is crushed
</p>

<p>
my favourite crush

              <h2 class="title-bold uppercase">June Poem</h2>
                  <p>I’m&nbsp;under midday sun<br />
diced bare by&nbsp;Reuterplatz trellis.<br />
I’m&nbsp;thinking about the incline<br />
your pelvis took<br />
and how your breath catches<br />
when you wedge into me,<br />
when what’s&nbsp;usually plaza<br />
a&nbsp;tight street<br />
leads off from becomes<br />
shadowboxing.<br />
The cosmos bends you<br />
over at&nbsp;your best and worst.<br />
Let all of&nbsp;it&nbsp;lap you,<br />
twice, three times round.<br />
Belted by&nbsp;it&nbsp;let the shift we<br />
might shape be<br />
mutual. Retune<br />
the militant you<br />
thought you<br />
knew me&nbsp;like.<br />
You’re&nbsp;not a&nbsp;warship.<br />
I&nbsp;never wasn’t&nbsp;mutant<br />
under midday sun<br />
the Reuterplatz trellis<br />
cuts but cuts hardly.<br />
The aliens are here already.</p>
              <h2 class="title-bold uppercase">Pilot light</h2>
              <p>I&nbsp;find what I&nbsp;want to&nbsp;be&nbsp;simple<br />
as&nbsp;time splayed<br />
over dayfuse<br />
Maintenance and red weight get<br />
taken off the image<br />
and a&nbsp;visible pilot<br />
with the flame still cradled</p>
<p>Maybe I’m&nbsp;bugging<br />
Maybe what crowbar<br />
hope funded sits idle<br />
against a&nbsp;corner of&nbsp;granite<br />
no&nbsp;longer and the flicker<br />
one saw that light funnel<br />
Saturday was<br />
no&nbsp;fire just coin</p>
<p>What a&nbsp;palm it&nbsp;is<br />
regardless that the odds<br />
I’m&nbsp;at&nbsp;with you soften<br />
get their due given<br />
seem to&nbsp;say what<br />
pact rhythm rides with air<br />
Know it’s&nbsp;tripwire<br />
and tenable<br />
as&nbsp;red wind and know<br />
to&nbsp;hold it&nbsp;nonetheless</p>

          <p>yes i&rsquo;m here to&nbsp;feed you, starvation break beats and brats it&nbsp;writes, shedding cobra plant tears green haze flower floor piece. do&nbsp;you remember when we&nbsp;made art? bolt horoscopes for my&nbsp;heart. start with a&nbsp;little, size, a&nbsp;little&nbsp;&mdash; size, for it&rsquo;s tight, you know. and when it&rsquo;s a&nbsp;slow 6 meter wave pound just like booom (say it&nbsp;slowly) i&nbsp;bend and swirl my&nbsp;axis around your pelvis, trying to&nbsp;get in, a&nbsp;soft landing it&nbsp;is, rhythmic purple choreographed on&nbsp;top of&nbsp;your territory, the stickiness of&nbsp;unharming enzymes. language i&rsquo;m learning as&nbsp;i&rsquo;ve never spoken this situation. as&nbsp;i&rsquo;ve changed languages and never came back. do&nbsp;i&nbsp;want to&nbsp;come back? pose and wait, edit it&nbsp;as&nbsp;you wish. it&rsquo;s all about props and <nobr>add-ons</nobr>, in&nbsp;the beginning there was nothing.</p>
<p>and now i&nbsp;find you, yet another person on&nbsp;a&nbsp;post, yet another image on&nbsp;the phone, please&hellip; life is&nbsp;already spent too much on&nbsp;the phone. this text as&nbsp;well this image, this form i&nbsp;am, this face bathed by&nbsp;constant humidity. today it&nbsp;rained all day i&nbsp;feel as&nbsp;if&nbsp;i&nbsp;went to&nbsp;sports, it’s&nbsp;like everything is&nbsp;set on&nbsp;the body. there is&nbsp;no&nbsp;fragility or&nbsp;fear of&nbsp;disintegration. it&nbsp;weights down, gravity is&nbsp;very clear at&nbsp;this point. is&nbsp;this what being ‘grounded’ is? i&nbsp;go&nbsp;towards the bathroom to&nbsp;wash my&nbsp;face but stop. to&nbsp;think that i&nbsp;was just bathed by&nbsp;so&nbsp;much humidity and nature, and i&nbsp;probably went against tons of&nbsp;things, i&nbsp;did, my&nbsp;clothes were dirty and then not, good things, but isn’t&nbsp;it&nbsp;like a&nbsp;special mascara? will the glow go&nbsp;away? but water is&nbsp;absorbed by&nbsp;the body, it’s&nbsp;in. i’m&nbsp;already preparing for meeting you. i&nbsp;think about the hair, how it&nbsp;became funky because it&nbsp;rained on&nbsp;it. i&nbsp;think about fat, how it&nbsp;makes me&nbsp;feel good, yes i&nbsp;dress again and run for the 15 minutes left, 5 euro for rice and tahini. uau this is&nbsp;a&nbsp;lot, i’d&nbsp;love to&nbsp;eat with you. 2 spoons one box, let’s&nbsp;share?</p>
<p>after trying out different top combinations, for some reason i&rsquo;m overlaying two of&nbsp;them, so&nbsp;i&nbsp;find a&nbsp;pair that goes well together, i&nbsp;feel hot, will they like me&nbsp;this way? this <nobr>bender-sports-femme</nobr>? horny and anxious like really a&nbsp;lot, i&rsquo;m sweating. and hungry. i&nbsp;hope it&nbsp;goes through my&nbsp;mouth to&nbsp;theirs and beyond. pulpitating, whatever it&nbsp;means, i&nbsp;want their pulpy body on&nbsp;mine, top or&nbsp;bottom we&nbsp;will see, hoping to&nbsp;see or&nbsp;rather feel everything eyes twist just a&nbsp;blanket of&nbsp;milky sea wave pound wave pound smoothly coated hardness. i&nbsp;don&rsquo;t even know what to&nbsp;say i&nbsp;just want to&nbsp;do&nbsp;it. the anticipated shivering, hex posed, witch feelings on&nbsp;top of&nbsp;blue hair swimming wet rumbles and rubs and oil and watery aloe mix for the hands that are softer than ever to&nbsp;touch with no&nbsp;friction zero obstacles, there&rsquo;s not a&nbsp;wall i&nbsp;couldn&rsquo;t climb at&nbsp;this point. i&nbsp;could masturbate and feel your weight set on&nbsp;me&nbsp;like a&nbsp;ghost, i&rsquo;ve only you met you once, but i&rsquo;d rather edge on&nbsp;the possibility of&nbsp;possibly getting fucked and fuck and grabbed by&nbsp;an&nbsp;unknown shivery sharp pound during a&nbsp;warm session of&nbsp;going in&nbsp;and out overload. will i&nbsp;be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;sustain this clarity and direct it&nbsp;at&nbsp;us&nbsp;or&nbsp;will this <nobr>build-up</nobr> create an&nbsp;arranged fragility of&nbsp;a&nbsp;big whisked mess? whisking desires of&nbsp;tips and edges randomly formed but ever smooth and never straight, i&rsquo;m ready to&nbsp;go&nbsp;ready to&nbsp;ride.</p>
<p>the coordinates for screams and wordless compositions, why wouldn’t&nbsp;you invite us, the menu of&nbsp;contacts, the availability we&nbsp;provide, i&nbsp;live next door. but you don’t&nbsp;feel it, not yet, not until we’re&nbsp;out. newborn availability, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;so&nbsp;clear at&nbsp;this point, i&nbsp;mean the light, yes this was some time ago, now it’s&nbsp;probably spring you get a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;it, and everything is&nbsp;sprouting and protruding through every hole and surface and the glands and the ones that fly sharing the powder, cupid it&nbsp;says, flying purple trace going out your ass, not oozing but rather misting, yes mists are hot. i&nbsp;think it&nbsp;also means shit, but yeah hot shit. rice cracks at&nbsp;the bottom, burned ignition, oat for breakfast, cold batteries, two hour and a&nbsp;half unwell conducted talk about nothing and everything at&nbsp;once, city fee, a&nbsp;long produced reply, morning heroine so&nbsp;much light, what are you doing before your finger meets the screen, the warmness of&nbsp;rested skin, and the dildo reaches my&nbsp;ass, are you up&nbsp;for grabs? lemongrass ice tea, a&nbsp;120cm mattress, a&nbsp;playground, she, this ground on&nbsp;which we&nbsp;avoid standing on, apparently you never heard me&nbsp;doing it, a&nbsp;well behaved rat tea tree draw a&nbsp;she and join the party for free.</p>
<p>getting back, back to&nbsp;thoughts, never to&nbsp;normal, if&nbsp;that&rsquo;s your guessing. guessing other peoples thoughts is&nbsp;mainly survival. i&nbsp;put the black beans to&nbsp;cook, add the spices according to&nbsp;a&nbsp;connection and my&nbsp;stomach makes alien sounds. it&nbsp;reads: it&rsquo;s perfect. small reminders, i&nbsp;can be&nbsp;whatever the fuck i&nbsp;want, just not an&hellip; ass holes are nice so&nbsp;i&rsquo;m out of&nbsp;vocabulary. when will there be&nbsp;a&nbsp;language for us&nbsp;to&nbsp;use?</p>
